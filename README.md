<h2>Hiee, Greeva here 👋</h2>

<p>
So here’s a <i>little</i> about me.<br>
I’m a curious learner who loves understanding how things work — from code and startups to human psychology, philosophy, and entirely new industries.<br>
I enjoy building skills across domains and constantly upgrading how I think, create, and solve problems.
</p>
I’m currently working on 🏃‍♀️<br>- A startup called AgeWell<br>- Personal and collaborative coding projects<br>- Exploring the startup and business ecosystem<br>- Understanding how technology, products, and people intersect<br>- Building consistency, discipline, and self-improvement habits<br><br>I’m looking to collaborate on 💌<br>- Startup ideas and early-stage projects<br>- Tech projects with real-world applications<br>- Hardware-based projects (even tho, it's not my domain but would love to)<br>- E-commerce ideas and platforms<br>- Research and exploratory work in defence and deep-tech domains<br><br>I’m looking for help with 🙂‍↕️<br>- Business growth and product thinking<br>- Improving coding depth and system-level understanding<br>- Turning ideas into structured and scalable projects<br>- Learning from people who build beyond tutorials<br><br>I’m currently learning 🙇‍♀️<br>- Software development and better coding practices<br>- Product thinking and startup execution<br>- Human psychology and perspective building<br>- How the business world actually works<br>and How to balance college, startup, and mental peace :(<br><br>Ask me about ⚡<br>- Exploring different domains before choosing one path<br>- Startups, product ideas, and early experimentation<br>- Psychology, philosophy, and human behavior<br>- Different theories, patterns, and conspiracy discussions, basically can discuss anything :)<br><br><br>Fun fact 😴<br><br>1. I’m deeply passionate about travelling, especially oceans and seas like, crazy obsessed🌊 <br>Even, My top bucket-list dream is to swim through Mexico’s cenotes.<br>Plot twist: I haven’t learned swimming yet because I once believed it would give me white patches on my face :(<br>Despite that, I have explored a wide range of activities, including art, dance, singing, archery, karate, and more, driven by curiosity.<br><br>2. Once, I sleepwalked down the entire building and stayed in the garden overnight while my whole family was asleep. It was the first and last time I ever sleepwalked xD<br><br>3. I never run out of stories :')
