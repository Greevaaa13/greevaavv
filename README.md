<h2 align="center">Hiee, Greeva here 👋</h2>

<p align="center">
So here’s a <b>little</b> about me.<br>
I’m a curious learner who loves understanding how things work — from code and startups to human psychology, philosophy, and entirely new industries.<br>
I enjoy building skills across domains and continuously upgrading how I think, create, and solve problems.
</p>

<h2>🚧 What I’m Currently Working On</h2>
<p><i>Things that keep me busy, curious, and learning</i></p>

- A startup called <b>AgeWell</b>  
- Personal and collaborative coding projects  
- Exploring the startup and business ecosystem  
- Understanding how technology, products, and people intersect  
- Building consistency, discipline, and self-improvement habits  

<p align="center">⋯ ⋯ ⋯</p>

<h2>🤍 Open to Collaborations</h2>
<p><i>I love building with people and learning along the way</i></p>

- Startup ideas and early-stage projects  
- Tech projects with real-world applications  
- Hardware-based projects (not my domain yet, but very curious)  
- E-commerce ideas and platforms  
- Research and exploratory work in defence and deep-tech domains  

<p align="center">⋯ ⋯ ⋯</p>

<h2>🧩 Looking for Help With</h2>
<p><i>Because learning alone has limits</i></p>

- Business growth and product thinking  
- Improving coding depth and system-level understanding  
- Turning ideas into structured and scalable projects  
- Learning from people who build beyond tutorials  

<p align="center">⋯ ⋯ ⋯</p>

<h2>🌱 Currently Learning</h2>
<p><i>Actively unlearning and relearning</i></p>

- Software development and better coding practices  
- Product thinking and startup execution  
- Human psychology and perspective building  
- Philosophy and critical thinking  
- How the business world actually works  
- How to balance college, startup, and mental peace  

<p align="center">⋯ ⋯ ⋯</p>

<h2>💬 Ask Me About</h2>
<p><i>If curiosity had a discussion board</i></p>

- Exploring different domains before choosing one path  
- Startups, product ideas, and early experimentation  
- Psychology, philosophy, and human behavior  
- Different theories, patterns, and conspiracy discussions  
- Or honestly… anything worth thinking about  

<p align="center">⋯ ⋯ ⋯</p>

<h2>🧩 Small Things About Me</h2>
<p><i>Random, real, and very me</i></p>

1. I’m deeply passionate about travelling, especially oceans and seas.  
   My top bucket-list dream is to swim through Mexico’s cenotes.  
   Plot twist: I haven’t learned swimming yet because I once believed it would give me white patches on my face.  
   Despite that, I’ve explored art, dance, singing, archery, karate, and more — driven purely by curiosity.

2. Once, I sleepwalked down the entire building and stayed in the garden overnight while my family was asleep.  
   It was the first and last time it ever happened.

3. I never run out of stories.
